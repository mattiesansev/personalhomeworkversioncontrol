1. I got the correct answers for the first 10 numbers in the sequence
1 1 1 2 2 3 4 5 7 9 12
I also tried PAD(1000) and I noticed that it took a very long time to evaluate. This is because the function works with recursion which can end up taking a long time. It took so long that I had to stop the prgoram.

2. For the first ten values of N, The number of additions is one less than the value of the number in the Padovan sequence. This is because for the first numbers that are 1, the number of additions are zero. After that, it takes 1 addition to reach the next 2 values, and after that, since we need P(N-2) and P(N-3), it takes 1 + (number of additions for N-3 and N-2) additions to get the value. Since the first addition values are equal to PAD values -1, we know that we will end up with 1 + PAD(N-2) + PAD(N-3) - 1 - 1, which will be equal to PAD(N) -1.
